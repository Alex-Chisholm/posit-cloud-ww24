::: {.notes}
One of the coolest things about Cloud is that it allows users, even the newest of new users, to simply ... go. This is especially important for anyone who is just starting out, as well as for anyone teaching them! The friction-free approach makes Cloud very, very well suited for instruction.

Back in the dark ages, either students did their R programming work in the Stats lab, or spent a lot of time getting everything set up and installed correctly on our own machines, which also meant spending a lot of time in the Stats lab. With Cloud, there aren't myriad different systems to support and keep up to date — we take care of that — and our features allow instructors to set their learners up for success by getting their hands dirty right away. No installation-hazing required.
